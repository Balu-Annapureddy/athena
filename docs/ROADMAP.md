# Athena Roadmap

*A living outline of Athena's evolutionary sprints and gates.*

---

## Overview

We follow the **Engineering Gates** methodology. Each sprint must pass a strict gate review before proceeding to the next phase:

$$\text{Specification} \longrightarrow \text{Implementation} \longrightarrow \text{Review} \longrightarrow \text{Testing} \longrightarrow \text{Documentation} \longrightarrow \text{Gate Approval}$$
